# HotAirBalloonGameSimulation
C# Applied object-oriented programming


My third and last project. Although, I enjoyed programming this the most and I genuinely tried to create something on my own, but the teacher did not think that it was a good program. In a way I agree that it is nothing special, but for me this is first try to create something more, not only to obey the tasks which are given by the university (http://uosis.mif.vu.lt/~vytautasa/TOP/ third task).

In this project though I tried to be very neat and to do my best at naming class as descriptive as possible. Also, I tried to obey all the rules of SOLID.
